		<h1>Description</h1>
		<h2>ASIC Miner Performance Evaluation Using Liquid Immersion Cooling</h2>
        <p>This study quantitatively assesses the thermal efficiency of ASIC Miner cryptocurrency gear submerged in the dielectric fluid <b>BitCool BC-888.</b> Using ANSYS Fluent, it examined how well immersion cooling controlled the significant heat flux produced by ASIC Miner systems. The simulation model depicts the mining gear’s power consumption as a volumetric heat source; the thermophysical parameters of BitCool BC-888 were included according to the manufacturer’s guidelines.</p>
        <p>Heat dissipation happens mostly via local heat transfer mechanisms, given that BitCool BC-888 has a boiling point over 350°C and shows low vapor pressure under operating conditions. Forced convection driven by a fan installed at the lower part of the cooling system—further enhances this. The high boiling point guarantees stable and efficient heat management for ASIC Miner devices as evaporation stays insignificant or completely absent throughout the regular operating temperature range of 40 C to 60 C.</p>
        <p>The miner and its surrounding domain, including the dielectric fluid, were modeled using Space Claim. This geometry was meshed in ANSYS Meshing with a fully structured grid. The total number of elements generated was <b>1,591,373.</b></p>
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>A temporary simulation solution was created with the pressure-based solver ANSYS Fluent to observe multiphase flow with time. The volume of fluid (VOF) technique was employed to track the vapor-liquid boundary. The Lee model was used for mass transfer between the phases of evaporation and condensation. The energy equation was included for incorporating heat transfer, as well as the realizable k–ε turbulence model with enhanced treatment of walls for improved turbulence prediction.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Ultimately, this work shows how well single-phase immersion cooling with BitCool BC-888 dielectric fluid controls the thermal performance of ASIC-based cryptocurrency mining machines(ASIC miner). Numerical simulations run with ANSYS Fluent revealed that BitCool BC-888’s high boiling point and low vapor pressure facilitated effective heat transmission. Forced convection by a fan helped localize heat transfer even more, enhancing the overall cooling performance. Particularly in cryptocurrency mining, where controlling heat flow is vital for device lifetime and operating efficiency, this study offers insightful analysis of the possibility of employing dielectric fluids in immersion cooling systems for high-performance applications.</p>
